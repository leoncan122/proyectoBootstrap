                        <p>First of all, you will need a skateboard for sure, and if you don't have one,
                            just ask a friend or try to get one of second hand on wallapop.<br> Just don't go to the
                            skateshop
                            and buy the skateboard whit the highest price, don't be a full.<br>You are at the begin of
                            this
                            new life and also you don't know if goint to like it.The only thing that need to work for
                            now
                            are
                            the wheels, so verify if them roll whitout problem, and if the table it's not cracked.<br>

                        <h2>Do an OLLIE.</h2>
                        <p>For now the only trick that you need to learn is the Ollie.<br>
                            <br>it's a basic thing, and the first, that you should learn. So the first rule is always to
                            start
                            and land(finish) a ollie or any other trick, it's BEND YOUR KNEES. this is the first and the
                            last
                            step.<br>
                            <br><em>But what's happen in the middle of the transition?</em>...<br><br>Put your backfoot
                            on
                            the tail of
                            the
                            beast,
                            and the front foot just a little before the screws.<br>
                            Whit your knees bended (not your body, keep your head
                            in her position, and im saying this because i see a lot of people trying to kiss the floor
                            when
                            they
                            prepare to do a trick) you should jump hitting the skateboard whit your backfoot, jump
                            straight(in the
                            same
                            point),
                            and quickly late do a little kick whit the front foot, and flicking your toe and draggin
                            your
                            table
                            forward.<br>
                            <br><em>How can i drag my table straight forward?</em>...<br>
                            <br>Then you jump you must bend again your backfoot in the air, and scrap your table whit
                            your
                            front foot
                            flicked.<br>
                            <br>This is all about timing and practice, practice, practice and practice.

                                link</a>, to understand what i'm talking about.

                        <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
                        <p>The first thing if you need to know is that you will hurt, there is no way to don't hurt it,
                            is
                            part
                            of the learning and practice, so if you have fear, do it whit fear but do it.<br>
                            <br>Then when you are ready to ride the beast, just put your foot that going to be placed in
                            front of your,
                            and then put on the other foot that rest on the floor, that will posicionated on the back
                            side
                            of the table, your feet should be over the screws.<br>
                            Prove to bend your knees a little or all that you feel comfortable, think that more bended
                            more
                            flexibility and
                            near to the floor, so less injuries and danger.<br>
                            <br>When you feel comfortable to push, you must put the backfoot out of the table bend your
                            knees again,
                            push forward to the point where the leg is straight, and repeat, and repeat, then you can
                            put
                            your
                            backfoot
                            again on the table.<br>
                            At this point, on movement, going forward, you body should rotates, so you vision will
                            keep seeing the way, but your body is in the same position that your skateboard(table).<br>
